# ðŸŒŒ Galactic Harmony â€“ Learning Tableau through Data Visualization

This project was created as part of my journey to learn **Tableau**, a powerful tool for data visualization. 

To practice, I explored a real-world dataset about galaxies and visualized patterns involving their mass, brightness, and distance (redshift). The focus of this project is not the scientific accuracy of the domain, but the process of **learning how to work with Tableau to create interactive, insightful dashboards**.

## ðŸš€ What I Learned
- How to connect and explore data in Tableau
- Building calculated fields and applying filters
- Designing clean, effective dashboards
- Asking questions and answering them visually

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
- Galaxy Morphology Classification (from Kaggle): [View Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/code/tatvajoshi123/galaxy-morphology-classification-1-0)
- CSV sample and Tableau file included in this repository

## ðŸ“‚ Files
- `dashboards-tableau.twb` â€” Tableau workbook file
- `document-pt.pdf` â€” Project summary (PT-BR)
- `document-en.pdf` â€” Project summary (EN-US)
- `Buzzard_DC1.csv` â€” Data sample

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
Learn Tableau by working hands-on with a real dataset, building visual answers to 4 analytical questions, and designing a dashboard that tells a data story.
